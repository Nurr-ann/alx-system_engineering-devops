Impact:
The website experienced significant slowdowns and intermittent downtime. Approximately 70% of users were affected, encountering either slow response times or complete inability to access the service.

Root Cause:
A misconfigured database query optimization led to excessive CPU usage on the primary database server, causing performance degradation and intermittent downtime.

Timeline
14:30 UTC - Issue detected by automated monitoring alerts indicating high response times and error rates.
14:35 UTC - On-call engineer confirmed the issue through manual checks and began initial investigation.
14:45 UTC - Investigated web server logs and network performance, suspecting a potential DDoS attack.
15:00 UTC - Realized the network was not under attack; escalated to the database team.
15:15 UTC - Database team identified high CPU usage on the primary database server.
15:20 UTC - Discovered a recent change in the query optimization settings.
15:30 UTC - Rolled back the query optimization changes.
15:45 UTC - System performance returned to normal; monitoring continued for any residual issues.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The primary database server experienced high CPU utilization due to a recently implemented query optimization. The optimization, intended to improve performance, inadvertently caused inefficient execution plans for several high-traffic queries. This resulted in CPU saturation, slowing down the database and, consequently, the entire website.

Resolution:
Upon identifying the query optimization issue, the database team promptly rolled back the recent changes. This action immediately alleviated the CPU load, restoring normal database operations. Post-recovery, further analysis confirmed that the optimization strategy needed refinement to prevent similar issues in the future.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes:

Conduct thorough testing of database query optimizations in a staging environment before deploying to production.
Enhance monitoring to include specific alerts for unusual CPU usage patterns on database servers.
Implement a rollback plan for critical database configuration changes to expedite recovery in future incidents.
Tasks:

Patch the database server to the latest version to take advantage of recent performance improvements and bug fixes.
Add detailed monitoring for database query performance metrics.
Conduct a training session for the engineering team on best practices for database query optimization.
Review and update the incident response plan to include a checklist for database performance issues.
Schedule regular reviews of database configurations and optimization strategies.
By addressing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to prevent recurrence of similar incidents and ensure a more resilient and responsive service for our users.
